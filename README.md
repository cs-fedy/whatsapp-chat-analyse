# WhatsApp chat analyser

when chatting with a close friend, have you ever wanted to know: 
the number of messages sent by each of you or the average length 
of your messages or who texts first and the first text in each 
conversation or your chatting time patterns-hourly, daily, 
and monthly or most shared websites link or most common words that 
each of you use? from this came the idea of whatsapp chat analyser.

## version 1!

    words_count(msg_list, conversers)
    msg_count(msg_list, conversers)
    average(msg_list, conversers, msg_count, separator)
    words_frequency(media_id, msg_list, conversers)
    most_active_hour(time_and_date, date)
    most_active_day(date)
    most_active_month(date)
    most_shared_websites(msg_list, conversers)

## version 2!

    get_first_msg(time_and_date, msgs)
    get_first_text_count(conversers, first_texts)
    get_chat_long(time_and_date)
